# top-test-first-ruby
Author : xAndreaLx

I add a lib repository in each folder, because I use "rspec file_spec" instead of "rake" : problem of version of rspec, I also got warning because of 'should' deprecated. I try to use expect but got some matters too.
I need to come back to change for this.
Also need to retry 08_book_tittles & 09_timer, I dit them after had a look on some solutions.
